		<h2>Music</h2>

		<p>If you've ever wanted to hear any of my silly music in its original high quality glorious .flac, you've come to the right place!
		If you want anything else, like instrumental versions, project files, sheet music/tabs/chords, or a glass of water, just ask,
		I'm always happy to share :3</p>

		<p>"Albums" are ordered from most recent at the top to oldest at the bottom.</p>

		<p>"The Pile in the Back Corner of the Basement" is a collection of things that I don't consider worthy of "publishing", but
		still don't want to let go to complete waste. Like that pile in the back corner of the basement where you put stuff you don't
		want to throw away but also wouldn't leave out on display.</p>
