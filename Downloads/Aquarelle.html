		<h1>Aquarelle</h1>

		<p>This is my second "album", and is still in progress. What defines the cutoff point between this album and the last one? Beats me, it just felt
		like a good point to refresh. I suppose one big difference is most of the "Squirrel Songs" were intended for particular videos, whether or not those
		videos actually came to fruition. Meanwhile the songs on this album are more just things I make for their own sake.</p>
