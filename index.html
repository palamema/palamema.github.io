<h1>Howdy!</h1>
<p>You may be asking yourself,<br><i>What the hecc is this?</i></p>
<p>This is my personal site!</p>
<p><i>Great, but why in the name of Sam Hill does this exist?</i></p>
<p>I ask myself this exact question every morning when I look in the mirror.<br>
Oh, you mean why does this website exist?</p>
<p title="Of course I think it's a good question, I'm the one technically asking. :P"><b>Good question!</b></p>
<p>One of my favorite lost arts of the furry fandom is tacky personal pages which look like they're straight out of the 90s</p>
<p>Since those don't really exist anymore, my goal is to recreate that with my terrible HTML skills!</p>
<p>Also, I might post some stuff here if I don't know where else to post it.</p>
<p>This site is very much under construction, and I don't know if it will ever be <i>completely</i> done, it's just kind of a side hobby I may work on sporadically.</p>
<p>Until then, make yourself at home, and enjoy the horrible web design! <sup>But hey, these simple pages load so much faster than clunky modern websites!</sup></p>
